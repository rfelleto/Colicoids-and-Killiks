Disclaimer: I'd like to highlight that I'm not a part of the SWTOR development team in any form nor do I have any contact with them. This list is a passion project to help keep a detailed list of all the bugs and glitches that plague SWTOR: The Old Republic. Devs of the game may never see this list nor work on any of these bugs. This is a way just to bring some peace of mind to all of you and PERHAPS help devs in case they ever use this list to fix any bugs. 

May the force be with you all,
